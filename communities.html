            <!-- List of First Nations included in Treaty 1 -->
            <p>
                Treaty 1 was signed on August 3, 1871, involving the Canadian government and seven Indigenous communities of what is now southern Manitoba.
                The communities, known as Treaty 1 Nations, include:</p>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Brokenhead Ojibway Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Sagkeeng First Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Long Plain First Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Peguis First Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation</span></li>
            <li class="first-nation-item"><span>Swan Lake First Nation</span></li>
            <br>
            <!-- Description of historical context -->
            These First Nations agreed to terms around land rights, annual payments, and educational provisions in exchange for land cessions to the Crown.
            As the first Numbered Treaty, it set a precedent for Indigenous-Crown negotiations. Today, the Treaty remains relevant,
            with ongoing dialogues around rights and community governance.
        </ul>

        <!-- Section on Ethnic Affiliations -->
        <h2 id="ethnic-affiliations-title"><span>Ethnic Affiliations</span></h2>
        <p id="ethnic-affiliations-description"><span>
            The Treaty 1 Nations primarily comprise the Ojibway (Anishinaabe) and Cree (Nehiyawak) peoples. They possess distinct languages, customs,
            and cultural practices reflecting their diverse identities.
            These groups historically inhabited southern Manitoba and brought their connections to land and governance into Treaty negotiations.
            Presently, their cultural affiliations guide their ceremonies and traditions, enriching community life and interactions with broader society.</span></p>

        <!-- Section on Ongoing Contributions -->
        <h2 id="contributions-title"><span>Ongoing Contributions</span></h2>
        <p id="contributions-description"><span>
            Treaty 1 Nations contribute significantly to cultural preservation, economic development, and community welfare:
            <p>1. Cultural Preservation and Education: </p>
            Initiatives focus on language revitalization,
            traditional ceremonies, and youth education to share Indigenous knowledge with future generations and the public.
            <p>2. Economic Initiatives and Urban Reserves: </p>
            Urban reserves support business development and community services, fostering economic growth and self-governance.
            <p>3. Community Programs and Advocacy:</p>
            Health, education, and advocacy initiatives protect treaty rights and address inequalities, shaping policies to benefit their communities and beyond.
